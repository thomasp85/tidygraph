#' Graph measurements
#'
#' This set of functions provide wrappers to a number of `Ã¬graph`s graph
#' statistic algorithms. As for the other wrappers provided, they are intended
#' for use inside the `tidygraph` framework and it is thus not necessary to
#' supply the graph being computed on as the context is known. All of these
#' functions are guarantied to return scalars making it easy to compute with
#' them.
#'
#' @return A scalar, the type depending on the function
