#' Calculate node and edge centrality
#'
#' The centrality of a node measures the importance of node in the network. As
#' the concept of importance is ill-defined and dependent on the network and
#' the questions under consideration, many centrality measures exist.
#' `tidygraph` provides a consistent set of wrappers for all the centrality
#' measures implemented in `igraph` for use inside [dplyr::mutate()] and other
#' relevant verbs. All functions provided by `tidygraph` have a consistent
#' naming scheme and automatically calls the function on the graph, returning a
#' vector with measures ready to be added to the node data. Further `tidygraph`
#' provides access to the `netrankr` engine for centrality calculations and
#' define a number of centrality measures based on that, as well as provide a
#' manual mode for specifying more-or-less any centrality score.
#'
#' @param weights The weight of the edges to use for the calculation. Will be
#' evaluated in the context of the edge data.
#' @param mode How should edges be followed. Ignored for undirected graphs
#' @param directed Should direction of edges be used for the calculations
#' @param loops Should loops be included in the calculation
#' @param scale Should the output be scaled between 0 and 1
#' @param rescale Should the output be scaled to sum up to 1
#' @param normalized Should the output be normalized
#' @param tol Tolerance for near-singularities during matrix inversion
#' @param options Settings passed on to `igraph::arpack()`
#' @param cutoff maximum path length to use during calculations
#' @param nobigint Should big integers be avoided during calculations
#' @param alpha Relative importance of endogenous vs exogenous factors (`centrality_alpha`), the exponent to the power transformation of the distance metric (`centrality_closeness_generalised`), the base of power transformation (`centrality_decay`), or the attenuation factor (`centrality_katz`)
#' @param exo The exogenous factors of the nodes. Either a scalar or a number
#' number for each node. Evaluated in the context of the node data.
#' @param exponent The decay rate for the Bonacich power centrality
#' @param damping The damping factor of the page rank algorithm
#' @param personalized The probability of jumping to a node when abandoning a
#' random walk. Evaluated in the context of the node data.
#'
#' @return A numeric vector giving the centrality measure of each node.
