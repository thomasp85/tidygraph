This package provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network 
data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node
data and one for edge data. `tidygraph` provides a way to switch between the two
tables and provides `dplyr` verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides
access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their
use in a tidy workflow.

## An example
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidygraph)

play_erdos_renyi(10, 0.5) %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree()) %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  mutate(centrality = centrality_edge_betweenness()) %>% 
  arrange(centrality)
```

## Overview
`tidygraph` is a huge package that exports 280 different functions and methods.
It more or less wraps the full functionality of `igraph` in a tidy API giving 
you access to almost all of the `dplyr` verbs plus a few more, developed for use 
with relational data.

### More verbs
`tidygraph` adds some extra verbs for specific use in network analysis and 
manipulation. The `activate()` defines wether one is manipulating node or edge
data at the moment as shown in the example above. `bind_edges()`, `bind_nodes()`,
and `bind_graphs()` lets you expand the graph structure you're working with,
while `graph_join()` lets you merge two graphs on some node identifier. 
`reroute()` on the other hand lets you change the terminal nodes of the edges in
the graph.

### More algorithms
`tidygraph` wraps almost all of `igraph`s graph algorithms and provides a 
consistent interface and output that always matches the sequence of nodes and 
edges. All `tidygraph` algorithm wrappers are intended for use inside verbs 
where they know the context they are being called in. In the example above it is
not necessary to supply the graph nor the node/edge ids to `centrality_degree()`
and `centrality_edge_betweenness()` as they are aware of that already. This 
leads to much clearer code and less typing.

### More maps
`tidygraph` goes beyond `dplyr` and also implement graph centric version of the
`purrr` map functions. You can now call a function on the nodes in the order of
a breath or depth first search while getting access to the result of the 
previous calls.

### More morphs
`tidygraph` lets you temporarily change the representation of your graph, do
some manipulation of the node and edge data, and then change back to the
original graph with the changes being merged in automatically. This is powered
by the new `morph()`/`unmorph()` verbs hat lets you e.g. contract nodes, work on
the linegraph representation, split communities to seperate graphs etc. If you
wish to continue with the morphed version, the `crystallise()` verb lets you
*freeze* the temporary representation into a proper `tbl_graph`.

### More data structure support
While `tidygraph` is powered by igraph underneath it wants everyone to join the
fun. the `as_tbl_graph()` function can easily convert relational data from all
your favourite objects, such as `network`, `phylo`, `dendrogram`, `data.tree`,
`graph`, etc. More conversion will be added in the order I get aware of them.

## Visualisation
`tidygraph` itself does not provide any means of visualisation, but it works
flawlessly with `ggraph`. This division makes it easy to develop the 
visualisation and manipulation code at different speeds depending on where the
needs arise.

## Installation
`tidygraph` is available on CRAN and can be installed simply, using 
`install.packages(tidygraph)`. For the development version available on GitHub,
use the `devtools` package for installation:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('thomasp85/tidygraph')
```

## Thanks
`tidygraph` stands on the shoulders of particularly the `igraph` and 
`dplyr`/tidyverse teams. It would not have happened without them, so thanks so
much to them.
