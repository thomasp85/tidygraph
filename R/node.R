#' Querying node types
#'
#' These functions all lets the user query whether each node is of a certain
#' type. All of the functions returns a logical vector indicating whether the
#' node is of the type in question. Do note that the types are not mutually
#' exclusive and that nodes can thus be of multiple types.
#'
#' @param mode The way edges should be followed in the case of directed graphs.
#'
#' @return A logical vector of the same length as the number of nodes in the
#' graph.
