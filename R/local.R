#' Measures based on the neighborhood of each node
#'
#' These functions wraps a set of functions that all measures quantities of the
#' local neighborhood of each node. They all return a vector or list matching
#' the node position.
#'
#' @return A numeric vector or a list (for `local_members`) with elements
#' corresponding to the nodes in the graph.
