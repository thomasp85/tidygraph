Description: A graph, while not "tidy" in itself, can be thought of as two
    tidy data frames describing node and edge data respectively.
    'tidygraph' provides an approach to manipulate these two virtual data
    frames using the API defined in the 'dplyr' package, as well as
    provides tidy interfaces to a lot of common graph algorithms.
