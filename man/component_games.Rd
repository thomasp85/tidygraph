\description{
This set of graph creation algorithms simulate the topology by, in some way,
connecting subgraphs. The nature of their algorithm is described in detail at
the linked igraph documentation.

\itemize{
\item \code{play_blocks}: Create graphs by sampling from stochastic block
model. See \code{\link[igraph:sample_sbm]{igraph::sample_sbm()}}

\item \code{play_blocks_hierarchy}: Create graphs by sampling from the hierarchical
stochastic block model. See \code{\link[igraph:sample_hierarchical_sbm]{igraph::sample_hierarchical_sbm()}}

\item \code{play_islands}: Create graphs with fixed size and edge
probability of subgraphs as well as fixed edge count between subgraphs. See
\code{\link[igraph:sample_islands]{igraph::sample_islands()}}

\item \code{play_smallworld}: Create graphs based on the Watts-Strogatz small-
world model. See \code{\link[igraph:sample_smallworld]{igraph::sample_smallworld()}}
