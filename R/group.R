#' Group nodes and edges based on community structure
#'
#' These functions are wrappers around the various clustering functions provided
#' by `igraph`. As with the other wrappers they automatically use the graph that
#' is being computed on, and otherwise passes on its arguments to the relevant
#' clustering function. The return value is always a numeric vector of group
#' memberships so that nodes or edges with the same number are part of the same
#' group. Grouping is predominantly made on nodes and currently the only
#' grouping of edges supported is biconnected components.
#'
#' @param weights The weight of the edges to use for the calculation. Will be
#' evaluated in the context of the edge data.
#' @param node_weights The weight of the nodes to use for the calculation. Will
#' be evaluated in the context of the node data.
#' @param label The initial groups of the nodes. Will be evaluated in the
#' context of the node data.
#' @param fixed A logical vector determining which nodes should keep their
#' initial groups. Will be evaluated in the context of the node data.
#' @param type The type of component to find. Either `'weak'` or `'strong'`
#' @param directed Should direction of edges be used for the calculations
#' @param trials Number of times partition of the network should be attempted
#' @param steps The number of steps in the random walks
#' @param options Settings passed on to `igraph::arpack()`
#' @param ... arguments passed on to [igraph::cluster_spinglass()]
#'
#' @return a numeric vector with the membership for each node in the graph. The
#' enumeration happens in order based on group size progressing from the largest
#' to the smallest group
